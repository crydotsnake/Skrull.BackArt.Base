# Skrull.BackArt.Base Template

# Description

This is a website site package for a fictional pastry called "BackArt".
Currently, this package is still in development and there is not much in it right now.
Only the very basic site package setup with basic nodetypes, mixins, constraints, and also the configuration for tailwind.

I will try to document the development process here a bit and I will also create Issues for the open todos!

## Contributing

As there is not much in it right now, there isn't much to contribute code wise yet. But if you have any ideas for this project, please feel free to open an issue !
